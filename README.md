# Database-Management-Systems-Fall21
This repository holds the files for my Final Project for my Database Management Systems course that I completed back in the Fall semester of 2021.

# Short Description
I worked with a team of classmates to create a DB schema for a fictional summer camp association. In this final project we had to create at least 7 tables for the DB schema.
All the Final Project files are found in the [Unit03 folder](https://github.com/Ethan-Amsden/Database-Management-Systems-Fall21/tree/main/_Final-Project/Unit03).
