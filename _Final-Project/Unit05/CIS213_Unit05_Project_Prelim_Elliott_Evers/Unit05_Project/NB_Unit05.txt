Requirements for Project:

2 nodes - 2 from each relation
3 relationships

Cypher written to copy into neo4j and run as block.
Otherwise, relationship creation would look like:

MATCH (var1 definevar1)
MATCH (var2 definevar2)
CREATE var1 -[:RELATIONSHIP]-> var2

All values are placeholders.

dob inserted as text literal to reduce confusion on reading.
elsewise, dob reads as 20000101 (e.g.) instead of 2000-01-01.
could run as decimal integer, but would require parsing on extraction.

some field names changed from RSD for clarity and self consistency. sp. reg_num -> cprid.

Generated from RSD from previous project, using schema as presented by neo4j documentation.

Row = Node
Table_name = Label_name
Foreign Key = Relationship

Theory: benefit to graph db in reduction of necessary tables, as intermediary relations that primarily
associate FKs can be reduced to a relationship
